## 🏗️ Architecture

This is an Astro 5 project with React integration. Key architectural decisions:

- **Framework**: Astro with React support for interactive components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x for utility-first CSS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE npm or yarn)
- **Node Version**: Requires Node.js >=22
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration with comprehensive linting rules
- **Path Mapping**: `#/*` maps to `./src/*` for clean imports

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with two test projects:
  - `unit`: Plain node environment for simple unit tests
  - `integration`: Integration tests involving either database operations using
    docker through testcontainers, or UI component tests using vitest browser
    mode.
  - Runs on `localhost:4007` in development
